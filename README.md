*Luxury Watches Recommendation System*

**Overview**

The Luxury Watches Recommendation System is designed to assist users in discovering high-end timepieces that align with their preferences. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the system provides personalized recommendations based on various attributes of luxury watches.

**Dataset Features**

The dataset (Luxury_watch.csv) contains detailed specifications of luxury watches, including:

* Brand – Name of the luxury watch brand.

* Model – Specific watch model.

* Case Material – Material used for the watch case (e.g., stainless steel, gold, titanium).

* Strap Material – Material used for the watch strap (e.g., leather, metal, rubber).

* Movement Type – The type of watch movement (e.g., automatic, quartz, mechanical).

* Water Resistance – Maximum depth or pressure resistance (e.g., 50m, 100m, 200m).

* Case Diameter (mm) – Size of the watch case in millimeters.

* Case Thickness (mm) – Thickness of the watch case in millimeters.

* Band Width (mm) – Width of the strap in millimeters.

* Dial Color – Color of the watch face.

* Crystal Material – Type of protective crystal (e.g., sapphire, mineral, acrylic).

* Complications – Additional features such as chronograph, moon phase, GMT, etc.

* Power Reserve – The duration a mechanical watch can run without being wound.

* Price (USD) – The cost of the luxury watch in US dollars.

**Features**

* Content-Based Filtering – Recommends watches based on their specifications.

* Price-Based Recommendation – Suggests alternatives within a similar price range.

* Feature Similarity – Finds watches with similar case material, movement type, or complications.

* Personalized Suggestions – Uses user preferences to refine recommendations.

**Files**

* Lux_Savvy.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing data processing, model training, and evaluation.

* Luxury_watch.csv – The dataset with luxury watch specifications.

* readme.md – Documentation of the project.

**Usage**

1. Setup Environment

  * Install dependencies using:
    
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
    
2. Load and Preprocess Data

  * Use Lux_Savvy.ipynb to clean and transform Luxury_watch.csv.

3. Train the Recommendation Model

  * Run algorithms to generate personalized suggestions.

4. Evaluate Performance

  * Assess recommendation accuracy based on similarity metrics.

**Future Enhancements**

* Collaborative Filtering – Incorporate user purchase history for better recommendations.

* Deep Learning Models – Implement neural networks for improved personalization.

* Web App Deployment – Create an interactive platform for real-time recommendations.
